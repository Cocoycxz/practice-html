    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>In my free time, I dive into the fascinating world of computer programming. It’s a passion that lets me mix creativity with logic, solving complex problems and bringing new ideas to life. Whether I’m building a new web app, playing around with different algorithms, or contributing to open-source projects, programming always offers something new to learn and explore. I love the thrill of debugging code and making things run more smoothly—each challenge helps me grow my skills and deepen my understanding of technology. This hobby keeps my mind sharp and gives me a real sense of accomplishment and joy when I see my projects come to life.</p>
